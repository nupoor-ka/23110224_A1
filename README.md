The CSVs for all labs are larger than 600 MB, necessitating them to be put in another folder. They are available in this [OneDrive folder](https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/23110224_iitgn_ac_in/EqOt70HNI9BJuI88YxBqvQYBb3RfOX9YD4eLRPa7YExAsQ?e=UPm1TS).

The folders are organised according to the lab assignments.

The complete information extracted for Lab 2 is in the file "bug_fixes_complete". The scores and hit rates are in the file "commit_message_sample_scores.xlsx".
The information in "bug_fix_commits_metrics.csv" includes the metrics from radon and semantic and token similarities, done for Lab 3. The data from Lab 4 is in the files "consolidated_dataset.csv" and "final_dataset.csv".
